# JivniCare V1.0.0 — Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Document: 05-prd.md
# Version: V1.0.0 FINAL

---

## ⚠ STRICT RULES

1. DO NOT build any feature not listed in V1 SCOPE section
2. DO NOT add any feature that fails the V1 Founder Principle test
3. EVERY feature must serve patient, doctor, OR admin — not just "nice to have"
4. IF in doubt whether to build something — DO NOT build it
5. V2 features are listed — do not implement them in V1

---

## 1. PRODUCT VISION

```
JivniCare is a queue-first, same-day doctor booking platform
built for Tier-2/3 cities in Bihar and Jharkhand.

It eliminates the two biggest problems in local healthcare:
  Problem 1: Patients wait hours at clinic without knowing queue position
  Problem 2: Doctors have no system to manage patient flow efficiently

JivniCare gives every patient a token number from home.
Every doctor a digital queue system.
Every clinic a professional online presence.
```

---

## 2. MISSION STATEMENT

"Making quality healthcare accessible and organized
 for every family in Jamui and Deoghar."
```

---

## 3. TAGLINE

```
"Book Doctor Appointments"
— Clean, professional, English
