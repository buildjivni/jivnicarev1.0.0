# Version: V1.0.0 FINAl
---

## ⚠ STRICT RULES

1. EVERY page transition must match flows defined here
2. DO NOT add extra steps to any flow — friction kills conversion
3. DO NOT show empty screens — every state has a defined UI
4. DO NOT redirect patient to login before they search/browse
5. Login popup appears ONLY at booking step — not before
6. ALL error states defined — implement exactly as written
7. ASK NOTHING — execute exactly as written

BIDIRECTIONAL ADVANCE:
  Click [Call Next]:
    → Previous IN_CONSULTATION = auto COMPLETED
    → Next READY token = CALLED
  Click [Mark Complete]:
    → Current = COMPLETED
    → Next READY token = auto CALLED
```

### Flow D4 — Walk-in Add

```
Doctor clicks [+ Add Walk-in Patient]
        ↓
Modal/sheet opens:
  Patient Name (required)
  Patient Phone (required)
  Patient Address (required)
  Queue: [Regular] [Emergency]
  [Add to Queue]
        ↓
Token created with type=WALKIN
Appears in queue with 🚶 badge
```

### Flow D5 — Status Toggle

```
Doctor clicks status toggle on dashboard
        ↓
Bottom sheet / dropdown:
  🟢 Available — Accept new bookings
  🟡 On Break  — [Enter break message: "Back in 30 min"]
  ⚫ Offline   — Clinic closed for the day

On AVAILABLE selection:
  → availabilityStatus = AVAILABLE
  → isAcceptingBookings = true (unless daily limit reached)

On BREAK selection:
  → availabilityStatus = ON_BREAK
  → breakMessage saved
  → isAcceptingBookings = false
  → Profile shows calm inline break message. No auto-cancel, queue order preserved.
  *Note: The doctor cannot select or set a 'Queue Full' status manually. The system automatically computes and displays the 'Queue Full' / 'Fully Booked' badge on the profile and cards based on token count vs. daily limit (`totalTokensIssuedToday >= dailyTokenLimit`), and disables new bookings.*

On OFFLINE selection (manual override / end-of-day reset):
  → availabilityStatus = OFFLINE
  → isAcceptingBookings = false
  → Patient tracking page displays offline banner
  → Proactive push/in-app notification sent to all patients with today's bookings.
  → No auto-cancel — patients decide whether to cancel.
  → Profile remains visible for public discovery.

**V1 Doctor Vacation Handling:**
To handle vacations, planned closures, or holidays in V1, a doctor or receptionist must manually toggle their availability status to `OFFLINE` for the days they are unavailable.
*Operational Risk:* This depends on manual action by the doctor or receptionist. If they forget to toggle their status to `OFFLINE`, patients will still be able to book tokens for that day. This is an accepted V1 trade-off, mitigated through operational reminders.
```

## V2 DEFERRED DESIGN NOTES

### V2 Deferred — Blocked Dates & Schedule Overrides
Replace the V1 OFFLINE-toggle vacation approach with a dedicated `ScheduleOverride` model (per-doctor, per-date, blocked boolean + optional reason) and a calendar UI under "Manage Availability → Block Dates." 
*Implementation Requirement:* The booking-availability-check logic must query `ScheduleOverride` BEFORE falling back to the recurring `weeklySchedule`, and this check must run in both the search/availability display AND the booking-creation endpoint server-side — not just one of the two — so a blocked date can never be booked even via a stale client or direct API call.

Document complete. Every flow defined. No empty states missing.
