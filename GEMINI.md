## 4-LAYER ARCHITECTURE — ENFORCE STRICTLY

```
Layer 1 — UI (src/app/**/page.tsx + src/components/)
  ✅ Display only
  ❌ NO business logic
  ❌ NO prisma import
  ❌ NO direct external API calls
  ❌ NO JWT handling

Layer 2 — API Routes (src/app/api/**/route.ts)
  ✅ Validate input (Zod)
  ✅ Check auth (getSession)
  ✅ Call service function
  ✅ Return apiSuccess() or apiError()
  ❌ NO business logic
  ❌ NO direct prisma queries
  ❌ NO complex calculations

Layer 3 — Services (src/lib/services/*.service.ts)
  ✅ ALL business logic HERE ONLY
  ✅ Direct prisma access allowed
  ✅ Direct redis access allowed
  ✅ Returns plain objects (NOT NextResponse)
  ❌ NO HTTP response objects

Layer 4 — Data (src/lib/prisma.ts + redis.ts)
  ✅ DB client singletons only
  ❌ NO logic of any kind
```

---

## ARCHITECTURE RULES — NEVER VIOLATE

```
AR-01: No business logic in any route.ts file
AR-02: No prisma import outside src/lib/ folder
AR-03: No prisma import in any UI component or page
AR-04: All API calls from UI use typed fetch wrapper
AR-05: All forms use react-hook-form + zodResolver
AR-06: JWT never stored client-side (httpOnly cookie only)
AR-07: All sensitive data from server components only
AR-08: Use apiSuccess()/apiError() in ALL route handlers
AR-09: Never show raw error messages to frontend
AR-10: All queue state transitions via queueService.transition() only
AR-11: All token ops use Prisma $transaction (atomic)
AR-12: Booking atomic: SELECT FOR UPDATE + increment in same transaction
```

---

## QUEUE ENGINE RULES — NON-NEGOTIABLE

```
Token States (ONE-WAY ONLY — no reverse):
  BOOKED → AWAITING_ARRIVAL → PAYMENT_PENDING → READY → CALLED → IN_CONSULTATION → COMPLETED
  READY/CALLED → NO_SHOW (alternative)
  BOOKED/AWAITING/PAYMENT_PENDING/READY → CANCELLED (patient cancel)
  BOOKED/AWAITING → EXPIRED (04:00 AM cron)

Token Number:
  Regular queue: 1, 2, 3...   (NEVER changes after creation)
  Emergency:     E1, E2, E3... (separate DailyQueue, type=EMERGENCY)
  Walk-in:       Same regular sequence, type=WALKIN (badge only)

Queue Isolation:
  Each queue: unique(doctorId + date + type)
  Dr. Sharma's patients NEVER appear in Dr. Verma's queue

Atomic Booking:
  Prisma $transaction with row lock
  SELECT dailyQueue FOR UPDATE → check limit → increment → create token
  Concurrent bookings: IMPOSSIBLE to get same token number

Bidirectional Advance:
  "Call Next"   → prev IN_CONSULTATION = auto COMPLETED, next READY = CALLED
  "Complete"    → current = COMPLETED, next READY = auto CALLED

Queue Cache:
  Redis key: queue:{queueId}  TTL: 30s
  Invalidate: IMMEDIATELY on every state change
  Miss: fresh DB fetch

Cron (04:00 AM IST = 22:30 UTC):
  BOOKED/AWAITING tokens → EXPIRED
  Daily queues → CLOSED
  Doctor status → OFFLINE
  Stats update + search_logs cleanup (90 days)
```

---

## DOCTOR STATUS RULES

```
4 States:
  AVAILABLE: isOnline=true,  isAcceptingBookings=true
  BREAK:     isOnline=false, isAcceptingBookings=false, breakMessage set
  BUSY:      isOnline=true,  isAcceptingBookings=false  (queue full)
  OFFLINE:   isOnline=false, isAcceptingBookings=false

Profile always visible to patients — even OFFLINE
Bookings blocked: BREAK + BUSY + OFFLINE
New bookings only: AVAILABLE
```

---

## AUTH RULES

```
Patient:  Max 2 concurrent sessions → oldest auto-revoked
Doctor:   Max 3 concurrent sessions → oldest auto-revoked (3 devices)
Admin:    Max 1 session → new login revokes previous

OTP:      5 wrong attempts → 15 min block
          Resend: 25 second cooldown
          Expiry: 5 minutes
          Storage: Redis (hashed SHA-256)

JWT:      httpOnly cookie ONLY
          NEVER: localStorage, sessionStorage, Zustand
          Expiry: 7 days

Admin:    OTP login + TOTP (Google Authenticator) mandatory
          NO TOTP bypass — ever
```

---

## SECURITY RULES

```
Input validation: Zod on EVERY API route — no exceptions
SQL injection:    Prisma ORM prevents — no raw SQL (except JVC sequence)
XSS:             CSP headers + httpOnly cookie
CSRF:            sameSite=strict cookie
CORS:            jivnicare.com only
Rate limits:
  OTP:    5 / 15 min
  Login:  10 / hour
  Search: 100 / hour
  Admin:  200 / hour
  Booking: max 3 active / patient / day

Audit logging: ALL roles, ALL actions — fire and forget
Errors: NEVER expose stack traces or internal errors to frontend
Delete: SOFT ONLY → archive → deletedAt field
```

---

## DATABASE — 14 TABLES

```
users              → All user accounts (patient + doctor + admin)
auth_sessions      → JWT sessions (max per role enforced)
doctors            → Doctor profiles + clinic info + schedule
daily_queues       → One per doctor per day per type (REGULAR/EMERGENCY)
queue_tokens       → Individual patient tokens
platform_pricing   → Display-only fee structure per doctor
notifications      → In-app notifications
audit_logs         → Complete action history
archived_records   → Soft-deleted records
waitlists          → Queue-full waitlist
doctor_requests    → Lead capture (no doctor found)
search_logs        → Anonymous search analytics (90-day TTL)
districts          → Jamui + Deoghar only
specialities       → 20 specialities (tier-ordered)

Doctor ID: JVC001 format — PostgreSQL SEQUENCE
Slug:      dr-{name}-{speciality}-{city} UNIQUE
Clinic:    In doctors table (no separate table V1)
```

---

## SEARCH ENGINE — 5 LAYERS

```
Layer 1: Symptom → Speciality mapping (200+ terms, Hindi+English)
Layer 2: PostgreSQL FTS — 8 fields (name, clinic, bio, speciality,
         diseases, procedures, city, internalDoctorId)
Layer 3: Scoring (100 pts):
         Keyword 40 + Availability 25 + Distance 20 +
         Profile Complete 10 + Early Partner 5
Layer 4: Hard filters (district, gender, language, fee, emergency)
Layer 5: Ranked results (online first)

Minimum query: 2 characters
Empty result:  "Request a Doctor" form → lead capture
Search logged: anonymously in search_logs table
Rate limited:  100 requests/hour
```

---

## PAYMENT SYSTEM — DISPLAY ONLY

```
ZERO actual payment processing in V1.
Patient pays doctor directly at clinic (cash).
JivniCare collects NO money.

Patient sees:
  Consultation Fee:    ₹[doctor fee]
  Convenience Fee:     ~~₹29~~ FREE 🎉
  Total Payable:       ₹[doctor fee]
  Method:              "Pay at Clinic"

Doctor sees:
  Platform Fee Waived: ₹2,999
  Total Value:         ₹X,XXX saved
  These are display values only — no actual billing

Formula: actualCharge = perBookingFee × (1 - discountPercent/100)
         V1 discountPercent = 100 → actualCharge = ₹0

Early Partner: First 20 doctors — EARLY_PARTNER tier — Gold badge
```

---

## NOTIFICATION CHANNELS

```
In-app:         notifications table → UI bell icon
Browser Push:   Service worker (PWA) → doctor status + token called
OTP SMS:        2Factor.in → auth only (2 attempts, silent fail, then Resend button with 30s cooldown)
Email:          Resend.dev → doctor verification/approval/rejection
WhatsApp:       Infrastructure ready, NOT launched in V1
```

  → Cross-file analysis (eg: "Any prisma in UI components?")
  → Architecture violation detection
  → Pre-launch full audit

GITLAB DUO (code review):
  → Every pull request / merge request
  → Suggests improvements on changed files

## PHASE-BY-PHASE GEMINI CLI PROMPTS

```
Phase 0 (Foundation):
  "Read GEMINI.md and 04-trd.md Section 3.
   Does the folder structure match exactly?
   List any missing files or wrong paths."

Phase 1 (Data Layer):
  "Read 02-security-access.md.
   Review: lib/prisma.ts, lib/redis.ts, lib/utils/auth.ts,
   lib/utils/api-response.ts, lib/utils/logical-date.ts.
   Any deviation from spec? Report all issues."

Phase 2 (Auth):
  "Read 02-security-access.md.
   Review: auth.service.ts + all api/auth/* routes + middleware.ts.
   Find any security vulnerability or spec deviation."

Phase 3 (Queue Engine — MOST CRITICAL):
  "Read GEMINI.md queue rules + 06-web-flow.md Section 2 (Doctor Flows).
   Review: queue.service.ts + booking.service.ts.
   Is booking truly atomic? Can two patients get same token?
   Does state machine allow any illegal transition?
   Is bidirectional advance implemented correctly?"

Phase 4 (Search):
  "Read 03-search-engine.md.
   Review: search.service.ts + symptom-map.ts + api/public/search/route.ts.
   Are all 5 layers implemented?
   Does Hindi symptom mapping work?
   Is search logging anonymous?"

Phase 5 (Dashboards):
  "Read AR-02 and AR-03 from GEMINI.md.
   Scan ALL files in:
   src/app/(patient)/, src/app/(doctor)/, src/app/(admin)/.
   Find any prisma import. Find any business logic.
   Report every violation with file path."

Phase 6 (Pre-Launch Final Audit):
  "Full compliance review. Read all 10 documents.
   Check entire codebase against every rule.
   Find: V2 features accidentally built,
         security gaps,
         architecture violations,
         missing error states,
         payment gateway code (must not exist).
   Give me a production readiness report."
